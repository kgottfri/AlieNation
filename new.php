        <h2>Are We Alone?</h2>

        <p>One day may be some day maybe today.  If you think about our time on Earth, it doesn't seem that long since dinosaurs 
        roamed this place.  We think about our money, and our clothes, and the hottest celebrities.  But we never really get a chanced to 
        look up to the stars.  Look beyond the clouds to the planets up above.  Do you really think that you are alone in this universe?    
        The fact that you exist shows that life is plausible.  That consciousness does exist and that procreation is possible.  In the infinite 
        possibilities of an infinite universe, why is it so hard to conceive that there isn't something else out there.  Something else that 
        may be like us.  Something else that may have consciousness and perceived intelligence.  Why is it so hard to believe that they are seeking
        us as we are them?  Many believe that we are alone.  Many believe that we are not.  And amongst those many, some believe that we contact is imminent.
        And even fewer believe that contact has been made.  There have been many reports and sightings of potential E.T.  We've seen movies, books, and 
        aliens in all their different forms, presented to us.  If we can perceive their existence, the maybe, just maybe, it isn't so crazy 
        that they exist.</p>

        <h2>Potential E.T. Found</h2>
        </div>
        <div class ="divider"></div>
        <div class='align'>
        <p>A reddit user claims to have found E.T. in an unusal form.  The familiar face that we have seen portrayed in the popular SCI-FI
        movie has seemed have found its way into our reality.  If this is not proof enough that something exists, I am not sure what we 
        will need.  Besides actually being face to face with an intellectual being, the proof of their existence seems to find us in ways like 
        this.  The fact that we can recognize a face within this donut shows us that our minds believe that their is something there beyond the 
        contents of dough and deliciousness. </p>

            <p><q>Baba (grandmother) Vanga, (31 January 1911 – 11 August 1996), born Vangelia Pandeva Dimitrova, in marriage Gushterova, 
                    was a blind Bulgarian mystic, clairvoyant and herbalist who has spent most of her life in the Rupite area in the Kozhuh 
                    mountains, Bulgaria. Millions of people around the world were convinced that she possessed paranormal abilities. </q>
                    Baba Vanga is a prophet amongst the spiritual world.  She has the ability to predict things that are going to happen in the future
                    and she even has predicted some things that have already happened.  Baba is important to the Alien Nation becaue she predicts many interactions
                    with the extra-terrestrial kind.  <q>In the beginning of 1993 Vanga said that USSR will be renewed in the first quarter of the 
                    21st century. And before her death, she said her last prophecy: “A time of wonders and discoveries in the field of the intangible 
                    is coming. We will witness of the great archaeological discoveries that will dramatically change the perception of the world 
                    we know today. All the hidden gold will rise to the surface, but the water will leave…” This prophecy has not yet been 
                    elucidated, as well as the other part of it, that in about 200 years human kind will make contact with brothers from 
                    other worlds.She also said that many aliens have been living on Earth for years. They came from a planet, which in 
                    their language is called Vamfim,and is the third planet from the Earth, without any further information about the 
                    mysterious planet.</q> </p>
