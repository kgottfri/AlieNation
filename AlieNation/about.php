    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
    <p>WE ARE THE ALIENS.  We are the nation.  
       <br>Alien Nation was started by a student at the University of Vermont in 2016.  It began as a humble CS project and soon began to grow uncontrollably.
       People flocked from all across the world to model their dubious encounters with the Nation.  They had finally found a voice to project what they'd 
       been hiding in for years for fear of being ridiculed.  Students came to learn how to make websites.  Professors came to learn how to teach about 
       making websites, for it was the greatest website that the internet has ever seen.  Researchers came to write papers and the public came to awe.  
       No one would believe the things that they would read, but everyone seemed to continue to flock.  Eventually, the Nation began to grow too 
       rapidly, and they would need to relocate to the University of South-East North-Pole.  They hired some of the greatest researchers the humans 
       have ever seen, and some of the best CS'ers that universities have ever manifested.  Alien Nation soon began to rival NASA for their extra-terrestrial
       data that they were collecting.  Eventually by February 2017, the Nation had become the largest know collector of information that ever existed.
       Don't believe us? Just take a gander through our many pages and data.  While youâ€™re there, feel free to fill out the encounter report.  We know you've
       made contact, there's no need to hide it anymore.  We want to know, we care, we are the Nation.

    <h2>What is an Alien?</h2>
    <p>Basically an Alien is anything that doesn't live on Earth.  What is Earth you ask?  Well maybe you should go back to 1st grade.  
    Essentially as a human, you can be considered an alien if you are an outsider to any one area.  You are a foreign type.</p>

    <h2>What is a UFO?</h2>
    <p>Most UFOs are known as aliens.  Also know as an Unidentified Flying Object, we typically see UFO's in our night sky.  UFOs can range from
    anything to the military testing new equipment, flying saucers, or that bird that you don't really know what it is.  But any which way you say 
    it, a UFO is basically an alien to our airspace.  UFOs are our highest rated source of encounter with the extra-terrestrial kind.  Look up
    for an hour and two and maybe you'll find one yourself.</p>

    <h2>How Do I Know If I Was Abducted?</h2>
    <p>Short Answer: You don't.  Unless you specifically remember an abduction, chances are you don't remember for a reason and you never will.</p>
